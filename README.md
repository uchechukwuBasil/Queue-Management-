# Queue-Management-
This project is for queue managing problem solving. 
this works with the principle of FIFO order

This a working Queue management system I  created a class to hold the queue data, which are customer IDs (integers).
I made a Queue class, which has a size attribute, and an array, to hold the data of the queue.
The class has a remove() method to remove the front item of the queue, a print() method to output the queue.
Also a add() method for the Queue class, that will take an item and add it to the end of the queue.
This code is fully working.
